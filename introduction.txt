A distribution of values that cluster around an average (referred to as the “mean”) 
is known as a “normal” distribution. It is also called the Gaussian distribution 
(named for mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss) or, if you are French, the Laplacian
distribution (named for Pierre-Simon Laplace). Both mathematicians were working 
concurrently in the early nineteenth century on defining such a distribution.

The numbers work out as follows: Given a population, 68% of the members
of that population will have values in the range of one standard deviation
from the mean, 98% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three
standard deviations. Given a standard deviation of 5 pixels, only 0.3% of
the monkey heights will be less than 235 pixels (three standard deviations
below the mean of 250) or greater than 265 pixels (three standard deviations
above the mean of 250).


The mean is the average
The standard deviation is calculated as the square root of the average 
of the squares of deviations around the mean. In other words, take the
difference from the mean for each person and square it (variance). 
Calculate the average of all these values and take the square root
as the standard deviation.

The standard deviation is the square root of the average variance
